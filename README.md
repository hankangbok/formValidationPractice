# Form Validation Practice Project
This project is test-deployed at: 
https://kyouyatamax.github.io/formValidationPractice/

This project is based off the instructions for form validation practice at:
https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/forms-javascript

This project uses:
Javascript (HTML5 built in Form validation, JS HTML5 Contraint Validation APIconstraing ), HTML, CSS
ESLint, FlexBox

## Future Additions/Fixes: 
- <b> REDUCE THE CODE and wrap more things in functions </b>
- Case: An email confirmation matching and invalid original email should be considered invalid.
- Formatting: Make things prettier.
- The form isn't actually set up to send data to server. Eventually make it so the form submits to storage.
